# Predicting_Employee_Churn
 In this project I am  Predicting Employee Turnover with Decision Trees and Random Forests using scikit-learn.   In this project, I have used Python and scikit-learn to grow decision trees and random forests, and apply them to an important business problem.   Additionally I have interpreted decision trees and random forest models using feature importance plots.   Also Leveraged Jupyter widgets to build interactive controls,by which one can change the parameters of the models on the fly with graphical controls, and see the results in real time.   The employee churn dataset is taken from Kaggle
